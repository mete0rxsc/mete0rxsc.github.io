I didn’t study hard in middle school, which led me to attend a not-so-great regular high school (although some people studied for three years and still ended up in vocational schools, I managed to get into a regular high school without studying for three years). In our small county town, there are three regular high schools in total: one key school, and the other two are our school and another regular high school. The education system here still proves the saying, the worse the school, the more things they control. Our school’s education level isn’t great. Now that I’m in the second semester of my senior high school year, we’re required to wear uniforms to enter the campus every day ಠ_ಠ. I don’t understand why the uniform is so important. Do the leaders really want to regulate us, or is it to satisfy their own management and control desires? Not to mention our senior year, let’s briefly talk about the current senior three students. With just over sixty days left before the college entrance exam, the school leaders are still focusing on trivial things like hair and uniforms.
